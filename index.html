        <h3>WARNING: Common etiologies are trauma, infection, inflammation, malignancy, infarction, hemorrhage, or toxin/drug adverse reaction.  Given that the more common disorders are more probable by definition, it is efficient, and therefore prudent, to pursue common disorders first, and exclude them if they are not present.</h3>
